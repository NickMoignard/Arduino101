//MUEEC ARDUINO WORKSHOP
//lets blink an led and change the speed it blinks with a trim pot.

//  intialize led pin, set as constant
// trimPot is connected to ADC No.0 
//  initialze variable to store value from trim pot


void setup () {         // *note analog pins are automatically defined as inputs
  
//set led pin as an output
  
//open serial communication at 9600 bits per second
}  
void loop () {          
//read the trim pots value and store it
  
//lets print some information to the serial monitor and make it nice and clear

  
//turn the led on

//delay for a length determined by the trim pots value

//turn off the led

//delay for a length determined by the trim pots value
